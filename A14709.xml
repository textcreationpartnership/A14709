            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whiche was the cauſe, that when I had gone through with the tranſlation of theſe ſhort Sermons vppon Ioel, I thought with my ſelfe, that I could not better beſtow the fruite of this my labour (ſuch as it is) then vppon

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S ofte as I call to minde our olde friendſhip and familiaritie (right noble Eberhard) whiche firſt ſpringing vp at Marpurge within a while after grew more ſtrong at Regentſpurge in the aſſembly of the ſtates of the Empire there, which was holden in the yeere of Chriſtes incarnation 1541. I feele my ſelfe delighted with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler pleaſure. You were at that time conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the noble yong Gentlemen, which were of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to the moſt famous prince of the Heſſians, and I (for my part) by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie of your prince, had an honeſt place of allowance with thoſe excellent learned, D. Piſtorius, Draconite, Melander, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inus. All good men loued you for your free-hearted
<pb facs="tcp:3789:5"/>curteſie, and cheerefulnes and for the excellent qualities that were in you, But I aboue the reſt deemed that very noble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of your minde worthy eſpecially of prayſe and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, whereby you were prouoked euen amiddeſt the noyſe and ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flings of the court, and during thoſe affaires and dealings which were furtheſt off from the ſtudies and exerciſes of good letters, to giue your ſelfe oftentimes both to reading and writing: yea, and you proceeded euen then ſo farrefoorth in the knowledge of the Latine tongue, that you might ſeeme to be brought vp, not in the court, but in ſome famous ſchole of learning. And further if at any time we commoned more familiarly togither, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you would reaſon many things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grauely as touching the exerciſes of good learning, and complaine not ſeldome times that the ſame were neglected of thoſe, whom the nobilitie of their ſtocke had accuſtomed in princes courtes to aduance to the higheſt places of dignitie and honour. Wherfore at your requeſt I wrote an Elegie [or lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table Poſie] touching the ſtudies of our Germaine nobilitie, which not long after, was put forth in print, together with our bookes of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:3789:5"/>of Syllables and verſes. That was then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acceptable vnto you, and the ſame ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of loue which you ſhewed me at that time, hath euen now alſo moued me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to publiſh theſe mine homilies vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ioel vnder the authoritie of your name. For I thought it an vnlawfull thing, if there ſhould be no other teſtimony of our friendſhip pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely extant, then that which is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a fewe verſes, &amp; the ſame poured forth at auenture rather then written among the thronges of the aſſemblie &amp; concourſe of the courte. Again the ſtate &amp; conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs both ſeemed to require, that this our ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; familiarity ſhould be notified &amp; made knowne as wel vnto others, as alſo to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie (whome I greatly deſire to become heirs therof) by ſome monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of grauer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; not ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either of our callings. For you from the time, wherin we liued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, had not the loweſt place in the court of your prince, &amp; that your induſtrie &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did notably wel like the prince &amp; doth euen ſtil like him, I oftetimes perceiue by my fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: &amp; as for me, the lord called me to the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of his church the ſelfeſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e yere, that I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tſpurge wherin according to the grace geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me) I hitherto ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:3789:6"/>I ſuppoſed therefore that I ſhould do neither vnaptly not vnſittingly, if ſo be I dedicated this our Ioel eſpecially vnto you. Neither in deede doe I weigh their iudgements, who as they thinke the ſtate and condition of thoſe men that are conuerſant in princes courtes, to be very farre diſagreeing from the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the church: ſo are they of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that nothing can be done more abſurdly or inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niently, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if any thing be offred vnto head men in the common weale, that ſauoureth of diuinitie, &amp; of the word of God. For mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is farre otherwiſe, who do iudge the ſtates of men to be eſteemed &amp; accounted of rather according to the end, wherunto they aime &amp; leuel, then after the outward pompe &amp; ſhew: when as no wiſe man wil deny that among thoſe that tend to one &amp; the ſelfeſame end, there ought to be a moſt neere bond and coniunction both of minds &amp; ſtudies. But the very ſame end is propounded as well to thoſe that are conuerſant in the common weale, as alſo in the miniſterie of the church, namely, the ſafetie and preſeruation of their common countrie &amp; church: which the one ſort ought diligently to promote &amp; defend by their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and authoritie, and the other by doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:3789:6"/>and exhortations. There ought therefore to be a moſt ſure knot and coniunction betwixt theſe two orders: ſuch as wee reade was in times paſt betweene <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> alſo the Prophets and moſt holy kinges <hi>Dauid, Ioſaphat, Ezechias, Ioſias,</hi> and others lyke vnto theſe. But for ſo much as God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly author of the publike welfare, as alſo of all other good giftes beſide, it behoueth either of them (as wel magiſtrates as miniſters) to loke into his worde, &amp; out of it to deriue the fountains both of their counſels &amp; doctrine, and al to this end and purpoſe, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed to their charge may haue God fauourable vnto them, and in him enioy true peace &amp; felicitie. In which behalfe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters forſooth ought to be preſent &amp; at hand with the Princes and magiſtrates to teach &amp; admoniſh them: and theſe agayne ought to defend their authoritie. For ſo commeth that thing to paſſe, that Plato long agoe iudged to be very neceſſary in a common weale, namely that both Philoſophers ſhould haue the chief rule of thinges, &amp; they that haue the chiefe rule ſhould play the Philoſophers in deede. For why? that the true philoſophie cannot be fetched from any other where, then out of
<pb facs="tcp:3789:7"/>the word of God, it appeareth abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as this alone containeth the myſteries of the heauenly wiſdome, &amp; teacheth men to iudge rightly of things as wel humaine as diuine. In conſideration wherof God in times paſt ſaid: that the Iſraelites only were a wiſe &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding people, becauſe that vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone he had committed his lawes &amp; the oracles of his word. But with how great care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry the wil of God ought in theſe dayes to be ſought after, I ſuppoſe no man to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that doth not ydlely marke and obſerue the tokens of Gods wrath now euery where imminent &amp; at hand. Doubtleſſe al ſorts &amp; degrees of men complaine very much of the perils of our time, &amp; there is alſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery where, how &amp; by what means both the church &amp; common weale may beſt be prouided for. And we ſee no ſmall nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber vtterly to deſpaire of the ſucceſſe of things, &amp; to caſt of al care &amp; conſideration of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſafetie, when as they perceiue abrode ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies to be at hand, and at home al things to be out of order through diſcords &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: &amp; again publike diſcipline through the
<pb facs="tcp:3789:7"/>vnbrideled libertie of many miſerably broken and pluckt in pieces. But if ſo be they would hearken to the ſcriptures, they would by and by euen in the moſt perillous times of al, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter moſt certaine and aſſured perſwaſions of health and preſeruation. And that we may omit al other writers of Gods miſteries, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ioel may ſuffice vs in this behalfe. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied vnder the reigne of Ezechias, what time the church was aſſaulted with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Aſſyrians, and nowe brought into extreme hazzard: neither wanted there ſuch as by blowing the bellowes of newe ſinnes dayly kindled the burning wrath of GOD more and more. Neuertheleſſe Ioel wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the people not to diſpayre, neyther doeth hee forſake the office of teaching committed vnto him: But perceiueth that hee hath with ſo muche more diligence to apply himſelfe, if by anye meanes hee might finde a remedye for the afflicted ſtate. And this remedye hee ſheweth to conſiſt onelye in repentance and in the true conuerſion vnto GOD, whereunto he exciteth and prouoketh al men, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hee exhorteth the Prieſtes, and with
<pb facs="tcp:3789:8"/>theſe the other ſtates alſo of the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, that they would become the leaders of the people hereunto. To whom being conuerted vnto God, he promiſeth a ioyfull change and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thinges, and ſheweth them that the wrath of God ſhall be turned vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enemies themſelues, and finally prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth of the bleſſed inſtauration of Chriſtes kingdome. Neither in deede wanted his holy counſell happy ſucceſſe. For by the fearefull iudgement of God the hoaſt of the Aſſyrians was ouerthrowne by an Angel, and the grand captayne thereof Sennacharib (that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines of the fact might increaſe the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of his death) cruelly thruſt through and ſlayne of his owne ſonnes, being in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his God, and there buſie in offring of ſacrifice. And from that time ſprang vp amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the continuall afflictions of Gods people, the kingdome of Chriſt, which being long agoe by the Apoſtles happily ſpread abrod through the whole world, and afterwarde agayne op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the darknes of Antichriſt, God hath in theſe laſt times reſtored with mightie ſucceſſe, and dayly amongſt the moſt cruell ragings and deuiſes of the enemies, ſtill won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preſerueth it. Seeing therefore euen
<pb facs="tcp:3789:8"/>amidſt the extreame corruptions of maners and horrible idolatries, we may ſee ſo notable tokens of Gods grace and fauour: ſhall wee doubt of his goodnes, if ſo be that imbracing the counſell of Ioel, we turne vnto him with our whole heart, and caſting farre away al ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and alurements of ſinne followe the puritie of fayth and innocencie of life? Theſe thinges therefore ought the miniſters of the word and Sacramentes to vrge, theſe thinges ſhould be handled in the counſels of princes, yea theſe things are oftentimes to be propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of thoſe, that wiſh wel to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like welfare &amp; would haue things reſtored to a better ſtate. You ſee therfore (worthy Eber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard) that the argument of the Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth very well to vs both. And albeeit I doubt not, but that the matters by him hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led are eſpecially well liked of you, yet haue I thought good ſomewhat more largely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the ſame with you, to the intent that the Gentlemen of your place and calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred vp by your example may doe the like, and ſo endeuour to procure a remedie to the deſperate and almoſt forlorne eſtate of thinges in our time. And I beſeeche you by our ancient friendſhip, right worſhipful ſyr,

Theſe men are wonte by their intemperate liuing to ſeeke for prayſe and glory, and as though they were borne to conſume the good fruites of the earth, they deuoure all things throughe their vnſatiable throates. Thus doing, they abuſe GOD himſelfe with horrible blaſphemie, whoſe giftes they ſhamefully waſte and conſume.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3789:21"/>For it is much better, that wine and all manner of fruites periſhe at once, and that the lande it felfe be made waſte and deſolate, then that there ſhoulde be giuen matter and occaſion to theſe filthy hogges of Epicures hearde, whereby to offende both againſt the common comlines of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and alſo againſt the Glory of GOD himſelfe without ceaſſing.

                  <p>But omitting theſe Drunkardes,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3789:22"/>the Prophet turneth his ſpeeche to the Churche of the Godly,<note place="margin">The Church of the godly is willed to mourne.</note> and willeth them alſo to mourne. <hi>Mourne</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>like a Virgin girded with ſackcloth for the Lorde of her youth.</hi> So calleth hee the huſbande, whome GOD him ſelfe hath commanded to take the rule and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer the wife. And hee compareth the Churche of the Godlye to a wife or ſpouſe, which parable is euery where to be met with all in the Scriptures. But in this place it ſignifieth moſte bitter mourning. For like as the loue of new married folkes is moſt tender and ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo can there not bee but moſte grieuous mourning, if euen in the firſt beginning it be interrupted by the death of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. But he preſcribeth to the Godly a farre other cauſe of mourning, then vnto the Drunkards. For he willed theſe to mourne becauſe of the wine taken from them, for as much as they make account of nothing to be ſo ſweete and pleaſant vnto them as wine. But to the other he ſayth: <hi>For the meate offring and drinke offring is cutte off from the houſe of the Lorde, the Prieſtes
<pb facs="tcp:3789:23"/>that ſerue the Lord mourne.</hi> And in theſe wordes he ſignifieth the ſubuerſion of Gods worſhippe, whiche was grown by the terrour of the warre and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Land, as that whiche immediath followeth doeth teſtifie, when hee addeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>and the wine is dryed vp, and the oyle is decayed.</hi> For they vſed dayly in their meate offringes corne and oyle, and when they offred their firſte fruites they cooke alſo a certaine quantitie of wine. And in theſe kindes he comprehendeth the whole externall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which in the time of warre was for the moſt part intermiteed, when as they could neither goe vp to the temple that dwelt in Iudea, neither alſo were the fruites ſufficient for the daily ſacrifices in that horible deſolation of the whole land. This thing was moſt grieuous vnto the prieſtes, whom he ſayth therfore to haue mourned, when namely they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the preſent confuſion of thinges with the former concourſe of the whole nation vnto the holy rites. But for the ſame cauſe the Prophet biddeth alſo the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3789:23"/>reſt of the godly to mourne. For although it be lawfull for vs to lament our domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and priuate miſeries (ſo that it be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtlie done) yet for ſo much as the worſhip of God ought before all other thinges to bee moſt deare vnto vs, it behooueth vs to mourne, for this alſo eſpecially, if at any time we perceiue the ſame to fayle or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: and ſo muche the more bitter ought this griefe to bee vnto vs, for becauſe this thing happeneth by our default, whoſe duetie it was by our continuall practiſe of godlineſſe and innocencie, to mamtaine and defend the true ſeruice and worſhip of GOD. It is a griefe to the childe, if he heare the honour of his father to come in danger. But if he ſee the ſame to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by his owne ouerſight, that ſeemeth indeede vnto him a thing intoſterable.</p>
                  <p>The like conſideration is to bee had of Gods children, who are wont to preferre the glory of God before all maner of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and euen before their owne proper life it ſelfe. This thing bewrayeth the great wretchedneſſe of the people of our dayes, who are at a point, whatſoeuer the ſtate of Gods worſhip and religion bee,

                  <p>Thirdly, he ſpeaketh to the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; vinedreſſers,<note place="margin">He prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth al the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And becauſe ſuch for the moſt part are led onely with preſent things, and haue no regard to thoſe thinges that belong to the worſhip of God: he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſelfeſame cauſes, which he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Drunkardes, and yet not ſo bitterly, for that they ſinned more through blockiſhneſſe and ignorance, then through malice. <hi>Be ye aſhamed O huſbandmen</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Howle O ye vine dreſſers, for the wheate and for the Barley, becauſe the harueſt of the fielde is periſhed.</hi> And forthwith he reckoneth vp diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kindes, and ſheweth that all is nowe quite taken awaye, which was wonte to bee a ioye and comforte vnto men. Neither ought this ſo often a repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one and the ſelfeſame thing to bee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3789:24"/>thought ſuperfluous. For there is no queſtion but that they all wepte aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, when they ſawe the cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to deſtroye all that euer was on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide. But they mourned no otherwiſe then like brute beaſtes, for that they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe thinges, which ſerued their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and delight: in the meane time as touching the pacifying of Gods wrath, they cared not much for that. Whiche blockiſhneſſe to the ende hee might driue from them, he efte ſoones heapeth together and inculketh whatſoeuer was done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common maner of warfaring by the vnaccuſtomed fury of the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: that ſo they might acknowledge the ſingular iudgèment of God, and beginue by that occaſion to conſider of their ſinnes.</p>

                     <hi>IOel</hi> the Prophet is wholy occupied in this, namely, that hee might rouze vp the people of his time, whome the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets of <hi>The Aſſyrian</hi> warre on euery ſide oppreſſed, to repentance.

For heereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that GOD will neuer wante ſuch, as by whoſe ayde hee maye pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe the wicked and vngodly, when as hee can vſe the moſt mighty nations and thoſe that are furtheſt of from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his name according to his owne good will and pleaſure.

                     <note place="margin">A particular declaration of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>For that which he propounded in generall, hee declareth by a diligent and long rehearſall of all that they (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the Aſſyrians</hi>) ſhoulde doe: where it is not needefull to ſtande vppon the woordes, ſith they are plaine and euident of themſelues, but rather the matter it ſelfe is to bee conſidered.</p>
                  <p>For the ende and ſcope of all, is this, namely, that he will ſhewe, that nothing can poſſiblye let, but that Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhall proceede, and therefore hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from them all thinges, wherein they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3789:46"/>might put any hope or confidence.

                  <p>Secondly, they ſhall come verye cruell and ſwift, and ſhall euen runne through the toppes of the Mountaynes, where there ſeemed to bee ſcarce any place for Horſemen to paſſe.</p>

                  <p>Thirdlye, as touching men of warre, all your warriours ſurdaunted onely with the fame and report of their enemies, ſhall feare and tremble, and ſhall with the paleneſſe of their faces teſtifie that they are afrayde: on the other ſide your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall runne hither and thither like Gyants, they ſhall ſcale the walles, they ſhall keepe their order with wonderfull diligence ſo as none ſhall bee a let vnto another: Moreouer ſetting a parte the feare of death they ſhall ruſhe euen into the middeſt of the ſwoordes, and yet ſhall not bee wounded.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, albeit ſtrong Cities bee ſet againſt them, yet ſhall they ſodenly paſſe through them, euen as through the open fieldes, and hauing broken vp the gates or battered downe the walles, they ſhall enter in at the very windowes. Finally ſo great ſhal be the rage and aſtoniſhment of your people, that the earth it ſelfe ſhall tremble, the heauens ſhall mooue, the Sunne and Moone ſhall be darkened,

For to let paſſe all olde examples, wee haue in our time ſeene manye of this forte, whiche maye teache vs howe vayne the Fortes and Defences are, that men doe prouide againſt GOD &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore leaſt any ſhould attribute theſe thinges to the power or rage of the enemies, hee teacheth expreſſely, that

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee haue heere to obſerue and marke that hee calleth expreſſely the Hoaſt, and Camp of <hi>the Aſſyrians</hi> Gods hoaſt and Campe, and hee acknowledgeth the Tyrant <hi>Sennacharib</hi> to bee the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of his woorde and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.<note place="margin">Eſay. 10.</note> So in <hi>Eſay</hi> hee calleth the ſame the ſtaffe of his wrath or furye.</p>
                  <p>Therefore GOD vſeth alſo the ayde of the wicked whyleſt hee will execute his iudgementes. And yet for all that are not the wicked excuſed whileſt they deſtroy Cities and Townes, and make
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3789:48"/>hauocke of all with fire and ſwoorde. For by their owne proper malice they are carried vnto miſchiefe, and the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or couetouſneſſe, or wrath, or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie that dritteth them forwarde, is of their owne growing, neither is GOD to bee charged with it.

                  <p>In theſe thinges ſhyneth foorth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, which ſerueth greatly both for our inſtruction and conſolation.

Wherefore he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the elders together with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and euen the ſucking Babes alſo, or ſuch as hang vpon the breſtes: the elder ſorte, that by their example they might go before others, whom either through their negligence or euill example they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore corrupted, and the infantes, that the parents being prouoked by beholding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, might acknowledge their offence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they procured deſtruction not onely to themſelues, but alſo to their infantes, and by remembrance thereof might bee ſtirred vp to the more effectuall and feruent deſire of repentance. For (like as we haue ſeene in <hi>Hoſee</hi>) Gods wrath is wont to ſtretch it ſelfe euen vnto infantes,<note place="margin">Hoſee. 13.</note> and brute beaſtes alſo, as is declared at large in the firſt chapter. Whiche onely reaſon ought to bee ſufficient to awaken vs from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: ſith it is ſo prouided by nature, that al men wiſh well to themſelues and to thoſe that belong vnto them.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3789:62"/>all the ſort of vs haue neede of the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods woorde and prayers, and it is a ioyfull thing to the Godly to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant among thoſe, with whom they knowe God to be preſent.

This queſtion is not ſuperfluous, conſidering that in times paſt the enemies of the Chriſtian faith tooke heereby occaſion to ſlaunder it, in that after the riſing thereof, they ſaide

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3789:87"/>This doubtles is the cauſe, for the which <hi>Chriſte</hi> himſelfe foretold that the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould bee rooted out,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>21.23.</hi> Luke. 19.</note> &amp; for which alſo the Romane Empire was manifoldly afflicted, as <hi>Oroſius</hi> in diuers places witneſſeth.

Where, if ſo bee wee looke vpon thoſe, that haue giuen their names vnto <hi>Chriſte,</hi> although they bee of a right iudgemente as touching faith and religion, and alſo do refreine themſelues from the groſſer ſins and ſuperſtitions, yet concurre there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges in them, which deſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kinde of diſcipline and chaſtizemente.
